1) Represent influence between users as a directional graph of users, save as a list of lines, as described next
$ grep type=replied_to downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2_NOBOT.tsv |awk -F '\t' '{print $6,$2}' | sort > a3_q1.txt


2) Produce clusters (groups of influence) by ranking the users who got replies by their number of replies. Keep only the largest clusters by "cutting" at a threshold of 3; in order words, keep just the graph for users who got 3 or more replies

$ grep type=replied_to downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2_NOBOT.tsv | awk -F '\t' '{print $6,$4}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -r|awk '{ if ($1 >= 3) {print} }' > a3_q2.tsv

4) Find the 30 most frequent hashtags in these largest clusters of replies you kept (for the users/tweets that got replied to, not the users/tweets doing the replies). Compare to the 30 most frequent hashtags you found in assignment #2 (overall, question 
$ grep type=replied_to downloaded_tweets_extend_original_nolf2_NOBOT.tsv |awk -F '\t' '{print $4}' | sort | uniq -c |sort -nr | head -30
